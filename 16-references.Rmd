<!-- 
  NOTE: this must be the last chapter in the book. It generates 
  a bibliography at the end of the document. Also,
  a chapter-level bibliography is generated at the end of each chapter.
  
  For PDF and e-texts, a bibliography is generated at the end of the book
  but there is no TOC entry for Bibliography. I don't know why...
