## Notes
Figures are in the gfx folder. They should not have dots in the names since that interferes with the crossref function. They should be named something like '01-intro.png' where the first two digits are the chapter number and then some simple description of the figure.

All images should be pre-processed to be 4in wide, 90dpi, .PNG format.

## Style Guide

Labels should be a chapter, colon, verbal desc (all lc with underscores): {#ch03_title}
For figures, label should be chapter, colon, ``fig'' and number: {#fig01_01}

Dates do not include an apostrophe: In the 1960s this happened...

## Markdown

### footnote

This is a footnote reference,[^1] and then the text goes on.

[^1]: Here is the footnote referenced above. The number doesn't much matter since footnotes are sequentially numbered in the output, it is only used to match the reference to its footnote. Footnote text must be separated from other text by a blank line. To add more paragraphs to the footnote, just indent all subsequent paragraphs that belong to the note. 

### Images
Normal image:
![This is the caption](gfx/image.png)

For inline image, put a NBSP after the image tag. This will also force the image to stay in its location instead of on the next page.
![This image won't be a figure](gfx/image.png)\

For attributes:
![Caption](gfx/image.png){#id .class width=30 height=20px}
